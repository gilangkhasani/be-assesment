# Online Store Evermos

### Describe Issue

The main problem is that there is no validation when the Customer can put the goods in the cart or checkout. Another problem is data integration. Partners can definitely sell offline (independently) or use other platforms. When there are transactions outside the Evermos platform, data integration plays a role in minimizing data errors.

### Solution
1. Create validation when the Customer is in the cart module or checkout module. Maybe, the solution is simple but when the solution is not implemented then the Customer can complete up to the payment module. As a Customer, I'll disappointed when my order is done and i already paid then cancelled due to stock unavailability. 
2. Data Integration, Maybe Evermos partners have a system or web service to bridge their existing data with inventory data or Evermose itself has a system that requires partners to always make regular updates in order to minimize data errors.
